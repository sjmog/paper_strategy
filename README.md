# Paper Strategy

A Media Game to play with some game principles and some OO.

### Getting Started

There are no project dependencies. Tested working in Ruby 2.3.1.

```
ruby run.rb
```

### The basic idea

People have different interests, and your paper can have its own subjects. :finished:

Over time, people will simulate a change in their interests due to both their own conversation and the current domination of subjects in the newspapers. :construction:

Your job is to choose which subjects to cover to beat the other competitive newspapers out there. :construction:

### Things

At the moment it's not so much a 'game' as me wondering how best to handle large populations of agents with varying attributes as they evolve and interact across time. Adding some player agency is, er, in the pipeline :).

It's also an opportunity to do a bunch of thinking about Clean Code I don't often get to do.

If interested in modelling, I guess [this line](https://github.com/sjmog/paper_strategy/blob/master/lib/subjectable.rb#L10) is probably an interesting place to start.
